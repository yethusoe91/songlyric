<b>"သူေယာင္မယ္"</b>

There's no rhyme and there's no reason
When you roll around and talk in silly accents
It's unbelievable and hysterical when
You leaned in to kiss me and gave me a black eye
But since then my vision's so clear
We don't have to try
'Cause it comes so naturally

It's our original love
'Cause no one gets me like you
I can't get enough
'Cause I light up when I see you
Original love
You're the bee's knees, sweetie
Our own kind of love

I feel miserable
It's indescribable when the smell of your shirt starts to fade away
The long distance, it's a bitch when
I'm making funny faces but you're not here
To make them back at me
I wish you could hear me laugh uncontrollably

It's our original love
'Cause no one gets me like you
I can't get enough
'Cause I light up when I see you
Original love
You're the bee's knees, sweetie
Our own kind of love

I like the taste of your sweat
You rock the beat of my heart
Your song's stuck in my head

It's our original love
It's our original love
It's our original

It's our original love
'Cause no one gets me like you

Original love
You're the bee's knees, sweetie
Our own kind of love

I like the taste of your sweat
You rock the beat of my heart
Your song's stuck in my head

It's our original love
It's our original love
It's our original

It's our original love
'Cause no one gets me like you
I can't get enough
'Cause I light up when I see you
Original love
You're the bee's knees, sweetie
Our own kind of love
